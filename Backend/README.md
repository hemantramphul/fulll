## Vehicle Fleet Management

### Overview

This project allows users to **manage a fleet of vehicles**, register vehicles, and track their parking locations.

In **[Step 1](https://github.com/hemantramphul/fulll/tree/step1/Backend)**, the focus is on **building the core functionality** of the fleet management system.

It is implemented using:

- **TypeScript** for structured and scalable code
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** for clear separation of concerns
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** for ensuring expected behavior through tests
